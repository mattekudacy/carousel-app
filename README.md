# 🚌 EDSA Carousel Tracker

A Flutter app to track your journey on the EDSA Carousel Bus System in Metro Manila, Philippines. Get notified when you're approaching your destination — even while you sleep!

## 📖 The Story

As a daily commuter on the EDSA Carousel, I often found myself dozing off during long rides. The fear of missing my stop was real! I needed a simple solution: an app that would wake me up when I'm close to my destination.

This app was born out of that personal need. It uses your phone's GPS to track your position along the EDSA Carousel route and sends you notifications when you're approaching your stop. No more missed stations, no more oversleeping past your destination.

## ✨ Features

- **🗺️ Real-time Location Tracking** — Continuously monitors your position along the EDSA Carousel route
- **🔔 Smart Notifications** — Alerts you when approaching your destination (configurable: 1-5 stations before arrival)
- **🧭 Automatic Direction Detection** — Intelligently determines if you're heading Northbound (PITX → Monumento) or Southbound (Monumento → PITX)
- **⏱️ ETA Calculation** — Estimates your arrival time based on current speed and traffic conditions
- **📊 Journey Progress** — Visual progress bar showing stations passed and remaining
- **🌓 Dark Mode** — Easy on the eyes for early morning or late night commutes
- **⚠️ Edge Case Handling** — Detects GPS issues, traffic slowdowns, and wrong direction travel

## 🚉 Supported Stations

The app covers all 22 stations of the EDSA Carousel route:

**Northbound (PITX → Monumento):**
PITX → MOA → Roxas Blvd. → Taft → Tramo → Ayala → Buendia → Guadalupe → Ortigas → Santolan →  Main Avenue → Nepa Q-Mart → GMA Kamuning → Quezon Ave. → PhilAm → North Ave. → SM North EDSA → Roosevelt/Muñoz → Kaingan → Balintawak → Bagong Barrio → Monumento
